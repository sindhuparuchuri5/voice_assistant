## 1. Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Docker**: Ensure that Docker is installed and running on your machine. You can download Docker from the official website: [Docker Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

- **Git Bash (for Windows users)**: Git Bash provides a Unix-like command-line environment for Windows. It is required for running shell scripts within the Docker container. You can download Git Bash from the official website: [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

## 2. Building the Docker Image <a name="building-the-docker-image"></a>
To build the Docker image, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository containing the Voice_Assistant project files to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/sindhuparuchuri5/voice_assistant.git


2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project files are located:

cd voice_assistant
3. Run the following command to build the Docker image:
docker build -t voice_assistant_image .

This command will build the Docker image based on the provided Dockerfile and tag it with the name `voice_assistant_image`.

## 3. Running the Container <a name="running-the-container"></a>
Once the Docker image is built, you can run the container using the following steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to start the container:
docker run -v "<LOCAL_LOGS_PATH>:/voice_assistant/logs" -e PULSE_SERVER=host.docker.internal --name voice_assistant_container -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --group-add audio voice_assistant_image

Replace `<LOCAL_LOGS_PATH>` with the absolute path to the directory on your local machine where you want to store the interaction logs.

- `-v "<LOCAL_LOGS_PATH>:/voice_assistant/logs"`: Mounts the local logs directory into the container at `/voice_assistant/logs`.
- `-e PULSE_SERVER=host.docker.internal`: Sets the PulseAudio server address to `host.docker.internal` for audio support.
- `--name voice_assistant_container`: Assigns a name to the container for easy reference.
- `-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY`: Enables display access for GUI applications.
- `--group-add audio`: Adds the container to the audio group for audio support.

## 4. Interacting with the Voice Assistant <a name="interacting-with-the-voice-assistant"></a>
Once the container is running, you can interact with the Voice Assistant using speech input. Follow these steps to initiate interaction:

1. Ensure that the container is running successfully by checking the terminal or command prompt for any startup messages or errors.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the project files.

3. Run the following command to start the voice assistant:
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
